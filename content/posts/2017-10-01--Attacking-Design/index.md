Attacking Design was founded by myself and two fellow Leeds University Product Design graduates, [Owen Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ojwil/) and [Oliver Yates](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ollieyates/). It later grew to employ and a small team of local designers within the city of Leeds. In Oct 2015 the agency was selected for the Entrepreneurial SPARK business Accelerator program backed by PWC & Natwest. In Jan 2017 we collectively decided to close the agency down and take what we had learnt forward into our own projects.
