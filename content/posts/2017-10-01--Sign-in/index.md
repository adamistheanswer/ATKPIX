Cheps Entertainment, an app development start-up, briefed us to produce a range graphic deliverables as well as an app design for their Sign In project. We have worked for both Cheps and Sign In to produce full branding and logos, business cards, compliment slips and more to support their business getting off the ground.

The Sign In, app was developed in partnership with a number of Universities to monitor variables around student and lecturer performance. The overall aim of the app is to improve the university experience for students and ensure they get the best quality education for their money.

The key the challenges of the app design were making sure user experience was as intuitive and usable as possible, as well as ensuring the app was engaging and visually appealing. On top of this we had to ensure the software developers understood the exact flow of the user through the app, so it was programmed correctly first time.
With the Sign In app soon to be launched, we hope it will be a familiar sight on student smart phones around the country.
