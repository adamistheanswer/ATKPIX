The key themes targeted in the branding process came from contemporary street wear brands, this was to help differentiate the product from the niche technical outdoors brands and to add a level of familiarity for the intended audience. The final logo which was comprised of a simple inverted silhouette of the hood section of the sleeping bag with the strap-line (sleep ‚Äì wear ‚Äì explore) to communicate the various configurations the product can be worn in.

An initial prototype was produced in early 2014 to validate the design. From this rough prototype we concluded that the overall mechanism of the product would work and it was something that could be developed. At each critical stage of the design process a working prototype was manufactured in china and then evaluated. These stages covered appearance, dimensions, material quality and anthropometrics. The MK.1 was available in 6 colorways.

Upon generating the initial product design, the SLPY was soft launched at Boardmasters 2014 to coincide with the SLPY.com website launch. Prior to the grand unveiling further graphic assets we‚Äôre produced to support the SLPY launch based on imagery from a product photoshoot. These designs included: promotional merchandise, a trade-stand and a Fieldcandy tent collaboration.

## SLPY MK.2

After a just over a year of the MK.1 being on the market the MK.2 was launched. This product was manufactured in the UK which lead to increased production costs but resulted in a far more refined product. The marketing for the MK.2 was handled by Intermarketing agency in Leeds while Attacking Design still carried out product development.

The MK.2 made use of sublimation printing which allowed for the bags to become real statement pieces. The range of the MK.2 was far more extensive and featured several design collaborations with outdoor brands.
